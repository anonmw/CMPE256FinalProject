        "These are the 10 most similar subreddits to \"bestof\" using title positive similarities and cosine similarity.  If you look at the results, some of them don't actually make sense, likely due to the way that the dataset measures \"sentiment\".  From my personal experience on reddit, the bestof subreddit typically is supposed to highlight interesting or insightful posts.  On the other hand, subreddits such as subredditdrama or shitredditsays may refer to the same posts, but they are typically more negative about it (specifically, subredditdrama is about petty arguments that other people have posted, and shitredditsays is about bad things redditors say, so while these subreddits refer to the same subreddits, all they are actually pointing out is popular subreddits with a lot of engagement.  We can see that when posting the title negative similarities alongside it, there is a lot of overlap.  Clearly this somewhat confirms that for popular subreddits, there are lots of haters and fans.\n",

        "Looking at the sum and absolute similarities, we do see some differences between.  Generally, the subreddits with highest engagement in a sum and absolute sense will also have high numbers for positive and negative engagement, but the exact ordering does reveal the nature of the engagement.  For example, subredditdrama has a higher absolute rating than sum rating because so much of the engagement is negative, compared to something like titlegore, which has lower absolute overall engagement, even though more of it is positive."

        "Taking the L2 similarities with weighted averages of nodes of distance 2, we can see that it is fairly similar to the immediate neighbor similarities, though there are some differences in both ordering and content.  You could extend this concept to even further neighbor nodes of distance 3 or greater, and implement a recursive function to search in this manner, with decreasing weights.  This would give you potentially more interesting results, at great computational cost."

        "While we can look at cosine similarities of various derived matrices separately or combined together, there is clearly a lot of overlap between them.  Generally speaking, if a subreddit is referenced a lot in the title, it will likely also be referenced in the text, and any subreddit with a lot of negative references will also generally be popular overall.  The ideal goal would likely be to fine tune a combination of all of these potential similarity metrics to get the most effective combination, but measuring that is only possible on the scale of an actual technology company who are able to test these recommendations over a large active population.  Overall though, this type of graph analysis still falls into the typical issues of cosine similarity and recommender systems, which is that for very unpopular subreddits with few links, it is unlikely that you will recommend them."
